# 6502_spi
Bitbang SPI with MOS 6502 and 6522

This is the code I use to bitbang SPI on my MOS 6052 homebrew computer via an VIA 6522.

cc65 is used for assembly and compilation of the examples.

Only SPI mode 0 is supported, which is epough to talk to SD Cards.

## Examples:
An example to read/write blocks on an SD Card will follow.
